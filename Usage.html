<br>
      
      Every segment of society uses minerals and mineral resources everyday. The roads we ride or drive on and the buildings we live learn and work in all contain minerals. Below is a selected list of commonly used <mark>metallic</mark> and <mark>nonmetallic</mark> minerals, ore minerals, mineral byproducts, aggregates, and rock types that are used to make products we use in our daily life.The construction industry is the largest consumer of mineral commodities. Crushed stone is used for foundations, road base, concrete, and drainage. Sand and gravel are used in concrete and foundations.

         Clays are used to <mark>make cement, bricks, and tile </mark> . Iron ore is used to make reinforcing rods, steel beams, nails, and wire. Gypsum is used to make drywall. Dimension stone is used for facing, curbing, flooring, stair treads, and other architectural work. These are just a few of the many uses for these commodities in construction.

     The chemical industry uses large amounts of salt, lime, and soda ash. Large amounts of metals, clay, and mineral fillers/extenders are used in manufacturing.

     In agriculture, phosphate rock and potash are used to make fertilizer. Lime is used as an acid-neutralizing soil treatment. Mineral nutrients are added to animal feed.
         
       <br><br>
     <mark>Asbestos</mark> is a class of minerals that can be readily separated into thin, strong fibers that are flexible, heat resistant, and chemically inert. Asbestos minerals are used in fireproof fabrics, yarn, cloth, and paper and paint filler. Asbestos is used to make friction products, asbestos cement pipes and sheets, coatings and compounds, packing and gaskets, roofing and flooring products, paints and caulking, and chemical filters. Fibers are dangerous when breathed, so users must protect against fibers becoming airborne.
       <br><br>
       Cement is used for building materials, stucco, and mortar. <mark>Cement</mark> is :a mixture of powdered lime, clay, and other minerals that crystallize to form a hard solid when water is added (hydraulic cement) or as a binding material in concrete" (Kesler, 1994). An excellent overview of cement, its chemistry, and properties can be found in MacLaren and White.
