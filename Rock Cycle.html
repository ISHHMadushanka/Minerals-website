         <p>The rock cycle is a basic concept in geologythat describes the time-consuming transitions through geologic time among the three main rock types:
             <b>sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous</b>.
         
             As the adjacent diagram illustrates, each of the types of rocks is altered or destroyed when it is forced out of its equilibrium conditions.

             An igneous rock such as basalt may break down and dissolve when exposed to the atmosphere, or melt as it is subducted under a continent. Due to the driving forces of the rock cycle, plate tectonics and the water cycle, rocks do not remain in equilibrium and are forced to change as they encounter new environments. The rock cycle is an illustration that explains<mark> how the three rock types are related to each other</mark>, and <mark> how processes change from one type to another over time</mark>. This cyclical aspect makes rock change a geologic cycle and, on planets containing life, a biogeochemical cycle.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>The presence of abundant <mark>water</mark> on Earth is of great importance for the rock cycle. Most obvious perhaps are the water driven processes of <mark>weathering</mark> and <mark>erosion</mark>. Water in the form of precipitation and acidic soilwater and groundwater is quite effective at dissolving minerals and rocks, especially those igneous and metamorphic rocks and marine sedimentary rocks that are unstable under near surface and atmospheric conditions. The water carries away the ionsdissolved in solution and the broken down fragments that are the products of weathering. Running water carries vast amounts of sediment in rivers back to the ocean and inland basins. The accumulated and buried sediments are converted back into rock.<br><br>

A less obvious role of water is in the metamorphism processes that occur in fresh seafloor volcanic rocks as seawater, sometimes heated, flows through the fractures and crevices in the rock. All of these processes, illustrated by <mark>serpentinization</mark>, are an important part of the destruction of volcanic rock.<br><br>

The role of water and other volatiles in the melting of existing crustal rock in the wedge above a subduction zone is a most important part of the cycle. Along with water, the presence of <mark>carbon dioxide</mark> and other carbon compounds from abundant marine limestonewithin the sediments atop the down going slab is another source of melt inducing volatiles. This involves the <mark>carbon cycle</mark> as a part of the overall rock cycle.</p>

         <p>Geologic materials—mineral crystals and their host rock types—are cycled through various forms. The process depends on temperature, pressure, time, and changes in environmental conditions in the Earth’s crust and at its surface. The rock cycle illustrated in <mark>Figure 1</mark> reflects the basic relationships among igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. <mark>Erosion</mark> includes <mark>weathering</mark>(the physical and chemical breakdown of minerals) and transportation to a site of deposition. Diagenesis is, as previously explained, the process of forming <mark>sedimentary rock</mark> by compaction and natural cementation of grains, or crystallization from water or solutions, or recrystallization. The conversion of sediment to rock is termed lithification.<br><br><br>

Geologic materials cycle through various forms. Sediments composed of weathered rock lithify to form sedimentary rock, which then becomes metamorphic rock under the pressure of Earth's crust. When tectonic forces thrust sedimentary and metamorphic rocks into the hot mantle, they may melt and be ejected as magma, which cools to form igneous, or magmatic, rock.</p>
