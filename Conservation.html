         <p>As standards of living rise around the world, there is greater demand for durable goods and products manufactured from mineral materials. <mark>As large emerging economies</mark>, such as China and India, increase their participation in the global economy, demand for critical mineral resources is increasing at a rapid rate. That means that we are depleting our known mineral deposits at an increasing rate, requiring that new deposits be found and put into production.<br><br>

It takes millions of years for the formation of minerals. Compared to the present rate of consumption, the replenishment rate of minerals is very slow. Hence, <b>mineral resources are finite and non-renewable</b>. Due to this, it is important that we conserve the mineral resources.</p><br>
         
         <p>Following steps should be taken for conservation of minerals :
<br><br>
<b>1.</b> Modern advanced technology should be used for mining operations. It will reduce wastage of resources in mining operation.<br><br>
<b>2.</b> Metals like iron, copper, zinc, aluminium, etc. should be recycled for reuse.<br><br>
<b>3.</b> The minerals available in very small quantity should be replaced with minerals available in sufficient quantity. for example use of aluminium in place of copper.<br><br>
<b>4.</b> Alternative inexhaustiable resources of energy should be used in place exhaustiable sources of energy like hydro-electricity or solar energy should be used in place of petrol or diesel.<br><br>
<b>5.</b> Synthetic products should replace scarce natural products.<br><br>
<b>6.</b> Export of exhaustible minerals should be banned.</p><br>
